## Description
Packages for a benchmarking protocol for SAR colorization which contains a protocol for generating ground truth, data analysis algorithm, three spectral-based solutions, three deep-learning-based solutions, metrics, and performance inspections.

### Protocol
* "filepath_gen.py" is for generating the file path of the dataset. The last null string should be deleted manually.
* "gt_ihs_gen.m" is for generating ground truth images through the GIHS algorithm.

### Spectral_based_solutions
* codes for three spectral-based solutions, namely NoColSAR, LR4ColSAR, and NL4ColSAR.
* there is also a code for data analysis through scatter plots between the SAR band and the band of ground truth.

### CNN4ColSAR
* codes for spatial-spectral-based solution CNN4ColSAR.
* a test model file is also contained.

### DivColSAR
* codes for solution DivColSAR.

### cGAN4ColSAR:
* codes for solution cGAN4ColSAR.

### Models
* saved models of the proposed approaches for reproducibility.

### Metrics
* Matlab codes for Q2n.
* python codes for SAM and NRMSE.

### Performance_inspection
* Matlab code for data analysis between colorized SAR image and ground truth.
* python code for residual image comparison.

### SEN12MS_CR_SARColorData
* there are 4 train samples and 4 test samples.
* the whole train dataset can be downloaded by the following Baidu Netdisk link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1xHSDNXoQzo5xewMsjQCBrA?pwd=2h7y, passwordï¼š2h7y
* it is noted that the sar_train and opt_train are divided into several parts because of some restrictions, so the users can merge them after decompression. Additionally, sar_train_20, opt_train_20, and gt_train_20 are the trainset for LR4ColSAR and NL4ColSAR.
